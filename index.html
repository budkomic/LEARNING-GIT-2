       <h1><b>I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</b></h1>
       <h3><i>by U2</i></h3>
        <p>
           I have climbed highest mountain<br>
           I have run through the fields<br>
           Only to be with you<br> 
           Only to be with you<br>
        </p>    
        <p>
           I have run, I have crawled<br> 
           I have scaled these city walls, these city walls<br> 
           Only to be with you<br> 
        <p>
           But I still haven't found what I'm looking for<br> 
           But I still haven't found what I'm looking for<br>
        </p>
        <p>
           I have kissed honey lips<br> 
           Felt the healing in her fingertips<br>
           It burned like fire<br>
           This burning desire<br>
        </p>
        <p>
           I have spoken with the tongue of angels<br>
           I have held the hand of a devil<br> 
           It was warm in the night<br> 
           I was cold as a stone
          </p>
          <p> 
            But I still haven't found what I'm looking fo<br> 
            But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in the Kingdom Come<br> 
            Then all the colours will bleed into one, bleed into one<br> 
            But yes, I'm still running 
        </p>
        <p>
            You broke the bonds<br> 
            You loosed the chains<br> 
            You carried the cross<br>
            Of my shame<br> 
            Of my shame<br> 
            You know I believe it
        </p>
        <p> 
            But I still haven't found what I'm looking for<br> 
            But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
        </p>
